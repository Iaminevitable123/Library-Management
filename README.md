# Library Management System ‚Äì DBMS Project

## üìò Overview

This project is a Library Management System designed for the CSL-220: Database Management Systems Lab. It is based on the analysis of KOHA (an open-source library system) and demonstrates core database design and implementation principles, including normalization and CRUD operations.

## üîç Features

- Book issuing, returns, renewals, and donations
- User and employee management
- Library card and membership tracking
- Book reservation system
- Fine calculation and history tracking
- Auditing for book and employee data changes

## üîó Sample Application Reference

- [KOHA Demo](https://koha-community.org/demo/)

## üìê Methodology

### Business Rules

- A book can be issued only once at a given time.
- Each book has one physical location but may have multiple authors, publishers, and genres.
- One user can have one library card with a membership type.
- One shelf belongs to a single section but can contain many books.
- Return date must always be after the issue date.

### ERD and Schema

The system is designed following ER modeling and normalized up to 3NF and BCNF where applicable.

## üß± Database Schema (Post-Normalization)

### Main Tables

- `Book(ISBN, Title, ReleaseDate, ConditionCode)`
- `Condition(ConditionCode, ConditionDescription)`
- `Authors(AuthorID, AuthorName)`
- `Genre(GenreID, GenreName)`
- `Publishers(PublisherID, PublisherName)`
- `Sections(SectionID, SectionName)`
- `Bookshelf(BookshelfID, SectionID)`
- `Book_Details(ISBN, AuthorID, PublisherID, GenreID, BookshelfID, Row, Column)`
- `Employee(EmpID, Name, DOB, DOJ, Address, Email, Phone, JobCode, Password, ManagerID)`
- `Jobs(JobCode, JobTitle, Salary)`
- `User(UserID, Name, Address, DOB, Email, Phone, LibCard)`
- `Library_Card(LibCard, IssueDate, PendingFines, FinesPaid, MemberCode)`
- `Membership(MemberCode, MembershipTitle, BorrowLimit, TimeLimit)`
- `Borrow_Return(ISBN, UserID, EmpID, IssueDate, ReturnDate, ActualReturnDate, Fines, ConditionCode, Returned)`
- `Book_Reserve(LibCard, ISBN, ReserveDate)`
- `Book_History(UserID, ISBN, IssueDate, ReturnDate)`
- `Book_Donation(ISBN, UserID, ConditionCode, Date)`

### Audit Tables

- Audit logs for insertions and deletions in:
  - `Book`
  - `Employee`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Development**: SQL (DDL/DML), ER Diagrams

## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes

- Efficient and normalized relational database
- Full implementation of CRUD operations
- Enhanced user experience via reservation and search functionalities
- Security and reliability through auditing mechanisms

## üìå Limitations

- No support for multi-library branches
- No integration for employee payroll or automated notifications
- Sample data and scope scaled down for academic purposes

## üèÅ Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates key DBMS concepts including normalization, relational schema design, and system auditing. While limited in scope, it effectively models core library operations and user interactions within a single-branch library system.
